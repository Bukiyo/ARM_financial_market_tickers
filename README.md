Technical Questions

1. It took me about 2-3 days to complete as I had to go through the documentation and understand the task properly before commencing.

2. I would consider adding in extra features to improve the User Interface as well as the User experience like picking a coherent colour scheme, adding in transitions and possibly animations (if need be), dark mode/light mode, flags to represent the selected country as well as icons to represent the industry type.

3. I made use of arrow functions and template literals. Kindly find Code snippet attached in the mail.

4. I would follow these steps:
a) Check the logs. It would help guide on the approach to take.
b) Utilize performance monitoring tools to keep track of the application's performance.
c) Implementation of CI/CD. Small changes would be released at regular intervals so it would be easy to detect at what stage the issue emanated from.

5. I would do the following:
a) Create an endpoint to fetch a list of all countries.
b) Create an endpoint to get Country flags
c) Increase the daily usage/consumption limit for each endpoint. The current limit made it a bit difficult to conclude my tests.
d) Add a reasonable limit to endpoints that require an upgrade to allow users with a free plan get a chance to consume them. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the Market Stats(Time series) due to this constraint. It is only available on the Standard and Pro Plans.

6. I would rate myself a 7.5
